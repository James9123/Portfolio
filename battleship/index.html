<h1>Battleship Project</h1>
<p>This is my Battleship Project</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Battleship rules for new players: chose where your boats are. Then take a shot at the enemy. Then it's there turn to shoot at you. This continues until one player's ships are sunk.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>This is the code to my project I worked a lot on. Enjoy!</p>
